# How did you pick the question(s) that you did?
* "why are these questions important from a business perspective?": Having the availability to predict house prices gives businesses an advantage especially when deciding on which market to join.  It allows the business to concentrate their resources on a specific market and having the confidence to project their earnings very well. 

* "how did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?": The data cleaning method is based on intuition and simple Exploratory Data Analysis.  There were some variables which I thought was obvious in not making a difference in the model.  Some variables had to be changed and some were dropped.  Overall, I focused on variables that had a lot of meaningful data. 

* "why did you choose a given method or library?" The libraries I have used were the most typical in performing an EDA analysis.  libraries like Pandas and Numpy are essential when it comes to Data Munging.  Libraries like Seaborne and Matplot are important tools to use when it comes to visualization. 

* "why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?" Certain visualizations were helpful in understanding specific data sets within the KC_Housing data.  For example, box-plots were useful to visualize outliers, heatmaps were useful in understanding the correlations of each data sets, pair plots gives us a bird's eye view of how each data relates to each other, and histograms allows us to see how skewed the data is. 


* "why did you pick those features as predictors?"I picked 4 specific types of predictors: bedrooms, square foot living, square foot above, and square foot living 15.  
  **Bedrooms** would be a good predictor because normally, the higher the number of bedrooms, the higher the price of a certain house is. 
  **Square** foot living also is more of an intuition since the bigger the house, normally, the more expensive it is, especially in a state that is pretty rural in Kansas. 
  
* "how would you interpret the results?"
* "how confident are you in the predictive quality of the results?"
* "what are some of the things that could cause the results to be wrong?"
